# Magic-8-Ball-PHP

## Overview
This PHP project is a simple implementation of the classic Magic 8 Ball toy. It is designed as part of the Codecademy's Learn PHP course. The program prompts the user to ask a yes-or-no question and then provides a randomly selected answer, much like the traditional Magic 8 Ball.

## How it Works
- The user is prompted to enter a yes-or-no question.
- The program then generates a random integer between 0 and 19.
- Depending on the random number, a corresponding answer is selected and displayed.

## Usage
Run the script in a PHP-supported environment (like a web server or local PHP interpreter). Simply type your question when prompted, and receive your mystical answer!
