# Mad-Lib-Functions-PHP

## Overview
As part of the 'Learn PHP' course on Codecademy, this project focuses on creating a PHP function to generate a Mad Libs story. Mad Libs are short, often humorous stories with blank spaces that are filled in by the user.

## Project Description
- **Objective**: Write a PHP function that takes specific words as arguments and inserts them into a pre-defined story.
- **Story Template**: The project provides a story template with blanks.
- **User Interaction**: Users will provide words to fill in the blanks in the story, resulting in unique and potentially funny outcomes.

## Example
A classic example is the "Roses are Red" poem where certain words are replaced based on user input.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script in a PHP-enabled environment.
3. Follow the prompts to input your words.
4. Enjoy the quirky story generated by your inputs!

This project is a fun and interactive way to learn PHP basics, focusing on functions, user input, and string manipulation.
