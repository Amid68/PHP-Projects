# The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-PHP-Math-Functions

## Introduction
This PHP project is inspired by "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams. It focuses on using PHP math functions to solve a series of tasks, leading to the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything.

## Project Description
Each task in this project involves a specific PHP math function. You'll start with an initial value and apply these functions step-by-step. Use the PHP documentation to find and correctly apply these functions. 

## Tasks Overview
There are 10 tasks, each requiring a different PHP function. Here's a brief rundown:

1. **Convert Octal to Decimal**: Start with an octal string and convert it to a decimal.
2. **Degrees to Radians**: Convert the decimal number (degrees) to radians.
3. **Cosine Function**: Compute the cosine of the radian value.
4. **Rounding**: Round the cosine result to three decimal places.
5. **Natural Logarithm**: Calculate the natural log of the rounded value.
6. **Absolute Value**: Find the absolute value of the logarithm.
7. **Arc Cosine**: Compute the arc cosine of the absolute value.
8. **Radians to Degrees**: Convert the arc cosine result back to degrees.
9. **Floor Function**: Apply the floor function to the degree value.
10. **Final Calculation**: Subtract 47 from the floored value to find the solution.
